Nozama is a comprehensive look back at Amazon purchases. After you've exported your purchase data from Amazon in csv format, Nozama can help you make sense of all your spending. 

## Features
* Privacy focused / client-side only... no data is sent back to the server
* Groups purchases by category and item
* Sorts purchases by spending or frequency
* Graphs spending over time
* Stock comparison: if you'd spent your money on AMZN stock, how much would your investment be worth now?


## Development

PRs, totally welcome! Hopefully the format and whatnot is pretty easy to understand.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, so it follows standard next-type stuff.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

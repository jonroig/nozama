Amazon lets you export your shopping history as a .csv. Nozama helps you parse it.

Nozama is a comprehensive look back at your Amazon shopping. After you've exported your purchase history, Nozama allows you to sort / group / graph / filter your shipping history, see where all your money is going.

It might suprise you. It suprised me.

## Features
* Privacy focused / client-side only... no data is sent back to the server
* Groups purchases by category and item

## To Do
* Better international Amazon Order History export support (sample files help!)

## Development

PRs, totally welcome! Hopefully the format and whatnot is pretty easy to understand.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, so it follows standard next-type stuff.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
